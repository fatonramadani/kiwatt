      "title": "Frequently asked questions",
      "q1": {
        "question": "What is a LEC?",
        "answer": "A Local Energy Community (LEC), or CEL in French (Communauté Électrique Locale), allows households in a municipality to share locally produced solar energy. LECs benefit from a 20-40% reduction in network fees for shared energy, making solar more profitable for everyone."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "What's the difference between LEC, SC and SCP?",
        "answer": "These are three distinct legal structures in Switzerland. The LEC (Local Energy Community) covers an entire municipality with partial network fee reduction. The SC (Self-Consumption Community) is limited to a building or adjacent plots with full network fee exemption. The SCP (Self-Consumption Pool) operates with a single meter for the entire group. kiwatt specializes in LEC management."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "How do I get load curves?",
        "answer": "Your distribution network operator (GRD) provides load curves. Contact Romande Energie, Groupe E, SIG, or your local utility and request 15-minute interval data (CSV format) for all meters in your LEC. Most GRDs provide this monthly via email or a portal."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "Does kiwatt replace my distributor?",
        "answer": "No. kiwatt is a management tool for the LEC representative. Your GRD remains responsible for electricity supply, metering, and network fee billing. kiwatt handles the internal distribution and billing between LEC members."
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "How long does it take to get started?",
        "answer": "Most communities are up and running in under an hour. Create your account, add your members (or import from CSV), upload your first load curves, and you're ready to generate invoices."
      },
      "q6": {
        "question": "Is my data secure?",
        "answer": "Yes. All data is hosted in Switzerland on secure servers. We're GDPR compliant and never share your data with third parties. Your energy data and member information are encrypted at rest and in transit."
