        "question": "What is a LEC?",
        "answer": "A Local Energy Community (LEC) allows households in a municipality or neighborhood to share locally produced energy. The LEC benefits from a 20-40% reduction in network fees for shared energy."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "What's the difference between LEC, SC and SCP?",
        "answer": "These are three distinct legal structures in Switzerland. The LEC (Local Energy Community) covers an entire municipality with partial network fee reduction. The SC (Self-Consumption Community) is limited to a building or adjacent plots with full network fee exemption. The SCP (Self-Consumption Pool) operates with a single meter for the entire group. Wattly specializes in LEC management."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "How do I get load curves?",
        "answer": "Your distribution network operator (DNO) such as Romande Energie, Groupe E or SIG provides you with consumption data at 15-minute intervals for each meter in your LEC."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "Does Wattly replace my distributor?",
        "answer": "No, Wattly is a management tool for the LEC representative. Your DNO remains responsible for electricity supply and network fee billing."
